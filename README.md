# Developing-Data-Poducts---Project
This repo contains the supporting documentation and files for a simple shiny app developed for the Cousera Johns Hopkins Developing Data Products course in the Data Science Specialization.
The app is a BMI Calculator. It allows the user to input their weight and height. Once they hit submit, the app returns their calculated BMI. 

This repo contains the following additional files:
1. ui.R used to generate the shiny app
2. server.R second file needed to generate the shiny app
